# Server-Side-VB.NET-socket-example
Simple server-side socket example in VB.NET.

Functionality

Threading:

It uses a ManualResetEventSlim (stopSignal) to signal threads to stop gracefully.
Each client connection is handled in a separate thread (ProcessClient), allowing the server to handle multiple clients concurrently.
A list (threads) is used to keep track of all the active client threads.
Client Handling (ProcessClient):

The ProcessClient sub is responsible for reading messages from the client and sending responses in a continuous loop.
When the stopSignal is set (indicating the server should shut down), the thread will exit gracefully.
Main Loop:

The main loop creates and starts a new thread for each incoming client connection.
After setting the stopSignal, it waits for all active threads to finish using thread.Join().
Error Handling and Resource Management:

Try...Finally blocks are used to ensure proper cleanup of client connections and the listener.

Error Handling:

Exception Handling: It catches both SocketException and IOException, making it more robust to potential errors during network communication and file operations.
Custom ErrorHandler: A custom ErrorHandler class is introduced to log errors and potentially perform additional actions (currently, it only logs the error message).
Logging:

ILogger Interface: A simple logging interface (ILogger) is defined with methods to log messages and errors.
ConsoleLogger: A ConsoleLogger class implements the ILogger interface and writes logs to the console.
Log Usage: The server uses the logger to record messages and errors consistently.

Additional Considerations

Logging Framework: For more complex applications, consider using a dedicated logging framework like log4net, NLog, or Serilog. These provide more advanced features such as log levels, file logging, and filtering.
Customizable Error Handling: You could expand the ErrorHandler class to allow for different error handling strategies (e.g., sending notifications, retrying operations) depending on the type of exception.
Data Format: Consider using a more robust data format (e.g., JSON or Protocol Buffers) instead of plain ASCII for communication between the client and server. This would allow for more structured data exchange.
